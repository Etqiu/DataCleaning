        "question": "How does marker assisted selection (MAS) use molecular markers to improve traits in aquaculture?",
        "answer": "MAS links DNA markers associated with desired traits to select superior individuals for breeding, accelerating genetic improvement by identifying and selecting superior individuals without directly measuring the trait.",
